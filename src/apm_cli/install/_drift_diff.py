"""Diff engine for the drift-detection replay.

Compares a replay scratch tree against the working project tree and emits
:class:`DriftFinding` instances for every detected divergence.

Three finding kinds:

* ``modified``     -- file exists in both trees, but normalized content differs.
* ``unintegrated`` -- file is present in the scratch replay but missing from
  the project.
* ``orphaned``     -- file exists in the project AND is tracked in the lockfile
  ``deployed_files``, but is absent from the scratch replay.

Untracked extra files in governed directories are intentionally ignored so
user-authored content does not generate false positives.

Public names are re-exported from ``apm_cli.install.drift`` for back-compat.
